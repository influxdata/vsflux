### Building in Debug Mode

VSCode has an extension development mode that can be used for developing and debugging the extension.

1. `git clone https://github.com/influxdata/vsflux`
1. `cd vsflux`
1. `npm install` to install dependencies
1. `code .` to open the project in VSCode

Press `F5` within the editor. This will open a new VSCode window titled `Extension Development Host`. From here, open any folder with flux code.

The `Extension Development Host` window can be reloaded with `cmd-r` to pick up new changes to the editor.

Additionally, breakpoints can be added to the extension and will be triggered if executed by the plugin running in `Extension Development Host`.

### Sideloading the Extension

The extension can be sideloaded to test it end to end, instead of running in debug mode.

1. `git clone https://github.com/influxdata/vsflux` (if not already done)
1. `npm install` to install dependencies
1. `npm install -g vsce` to globally install the [extension manager CLI tool](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-vsce)
1. `vsce package` to build the package. This will generate a file ending with `.vsix`
1. In the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette), run `Extensions: Install from VSIX...` and choose the vsix file that you generated.

### Running a Local Language Server Build

If you'd like to build the language server locally and run it against the VSCode extension:

Requirements:

* Docker
* Node (> 12)
* Rust (> 1.40)

1. Clone the following repos
  - github.com/influxdata/vsflux
  - github.com/influxdata/flux-lsp
1. CD into the flux-lsp repo and run `make wasm` (requires docker)
1. CD into the vsflux repo and update `package.json` and change the dependency of `@influxdata/flux-lsp-node` to `file: <full path to flux-lsp>/pkg-node`
1. run `npm install`
1. Open vsflux in vscode and run (`F5`)
